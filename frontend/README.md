# React + Vite

This is a minimal [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) setup for a React project that includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some basic ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. **Start the Development Server**: Use `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server.
3. **Build for Production**: Use `npm run build` to create a production build of your application.
4. **Preview the Production Build**: Run `npm run preview` to preview the production build locally.

## Configuration

- The project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting with the recommended React rules.
- The configuration file is located at `.eslintrc.cjs`.

## Plugins

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
